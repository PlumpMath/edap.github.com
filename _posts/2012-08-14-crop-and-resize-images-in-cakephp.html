I've just created an helper and a component to make images thumbs easy to create. The
code is avaliable at this <a
	href="https://github.com/edap/cakePHP-crop-thumb">git repo</a>. <br />
I've used <a href ="http://www.tmatthew.net/jwindowcrop">jWindowCrop</a>, a
jquery plugin, in order to create the crop interface. There are a lot of plugins
out there to do
this particular job, probably the mosts famous are <a
	href="http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html">Jcrop</a> and <a
	href="http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/">imgAreaSelect</a>.
I've tried both of them, they are really well done and extremely powerfull,
neverthless, i've prefered jWindowCrop for his clearer interface. There is only
one window containing the picture that you want to crop, you can work directly
on this one, using only 2 controls: the zoom and the drag movement.I think it's
enough to do the job. I've found
smart the way to avoid the preview picture, used in the others two plugin.<br /> 
But sure, this works only if you know exactly the size of the picture that you
want to obtain.<br/>
To install it in your application and start to crop the images that you have
previously uploaded:
<ul>
<li>copy app/View/Helper/CropHelper.php in your app/View/Helper folder</li>
<li>copy app/View/Elements/* in your app/View/Element folder</li>
<li>copy app/Controller/Component/CropComponent.php in your app/Controller/Component
folder</li>
<li>copy app/webroot/js/jwindowcrop folder in your webroot/js folder</li>
<li>Include jquery and the Elements/jwindowcrop.ctp in the view where you need to display the
crop interface. Use the CropHelper inside a form, in order to generate the crop
interface.See "View Example" below.</li>
<li>In this same view, every image should be passed as an array. Set this array in
the controller, and set the folder to store your images. Look at this example to
see how to include the crop component.See "Controller Example" below.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Controller Example</h4>
{% highlight php startinline %}
class ImagesController extends AppController{
    public $components = array('Crop'); 

    public function beforeFilter() {
	parent::beforeFilter();
        $this->Crop->image_directory = 'files'; //image thumbs folder, 
        //has to be in your webroot, has to be same folder of the orginal image file
        $this->Crop->quality = 90; // 0 for no compression at all, 100 for the best quality compression
    }

    public function crop(){
        $this->helpers[]= 'Crop';

        if (empty($this->request->data)) {
            $images = array(
                        array(
                            'original_path' => 'dock.jpg',
                            'append_to_path' => 'thumb_medium',//name to append to the original one
                            'thumb_width' => '300',//desidered thumb width
                            'thumb_height' => '300',//desidered thumb height
                        ),
                        array(
                            'original_path' => 'desert.jpg',
                            'append_to_path' => 'thumb',//name to append to the original one
                            'thumb_width' => '100',//desidered thumb width
                            'thumb_height' => '300',//desidered thumb height
                        )

            );
            $this->set('images', $images);
            $this->set('image_directory', $this->Crop->image_directory);
        } else {
            foreach($this->request->data['Image'] as $id => $img){
                if (!$this->Crop->create_thumb($img)) {
			        $this->Session->setFlash($this->Crop->msg);
                    return false;
                }
            }
		$this->Session->setFlash("Image cropped");
        }
    }

}
{% endhighlight%}
<h4>View Example</h4>
{% highlight php startinline %}
	<?= $this->Html->script('http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js',array('inline' => false))  ?>
	<?= $this->element('jwindowCrop') ?>
	<?= $this->Form->create('Image', array('action' => 'crop')) ?>

	<? 
	if (!empty($images)) {
	    foreach ($images as $id_img => $img){
		echo $this->Crop->ThumbInterface($img, $id_img, $image_directory);
	    }
	}
	?>
	<?= $this->Form->end('Create thumb') ?>
{% endhighlight%}


To see a complete example, download the whole application(it doesn't require a database connection to work) and point your browser at: http://localhost/images/crop
