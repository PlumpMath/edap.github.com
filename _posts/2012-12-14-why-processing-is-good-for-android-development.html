2 weeks ago I have buyed this <a href
="http://pragprog.com/book/dsproc/rapid-android-development">book</a> written
by <a href="http://danielsauter.com/">Daniel Sauter</a>, it is a book oriented
to learn by doing, full of examples, that allows you to have a running
application on your mobile device in less than 10 minutes. Ok,10 minues for a stupid one,
neverthless, his simplicity was really surprising. But probably, this is
something inside the Processing language, not only in the book.<br>
After finishing my first very simple android application, an 8-bit looklike

of german irregular verbs</a>, i would like to
write down the reason that have suggested me the title for this post.

And Android too. Processing in only one abstract layer upper, but it could 
integrate all the functionalities provided by the Android API. The Ketai library,
goes in this direction. There is still some aspects where it is better to work
directly with Java (for example, parsing a JSON file), but i think that in the
future we will see more processing libraries like Ketai.
<h4>Oriented to Interaction</h4>
Processing was thought to "make things talk". Touch, move, shake it, flip it,
pinch it. 
<h4>Low Barriers</h4>
Processing has catched the attention of lot of designers and artists. People
that probably have never written an "hallo world" before know such a tool like
processing. These people are now an incredible resource to build better
mobile applications. Ok, people writing code without knowing how to code are like people
driving a car without know how to drive a car. But also programmers, normally,
suck at design interfaces. Processing is simple the glue between this 2 worlds,
and
