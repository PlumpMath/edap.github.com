2 weeks ago I have buyed this <a href
="http://pragprog.com/book/dsproc/rapid-android-development">book</a> written
by <a href="http://danielsauter.com/">Daniel Sauter</a>, it is a book oriented
to learn by doing, full of examples, that allows you to have a running
application on your mobile device in less than 10 minutes. Ok,10 minues for a stupid one,
neverthless, his simplicity was really surprising. But probably, this is
something inside the Processing language, not only present in this book.<br>
After finishing my first very simple android application, an 8-bit looklike
<a href ="http://edapx.com/ja-irre-verben/">videogame to learn participle forms
of german irregular verbs</a>, i would like to
write down the reasons that have suggested me the title for this post.
<h4>Processing is based on Java</h4>
And Android too. Processing is only one abstract layer upper, but it could 
integrate all the functionalities provided by the Android API. <a
	href="https://code.google.com/p/ketai/">The Ketai library</a>,
goes in this direction. There is still some aspects where it is better to work
directly with Java (for example, in my application i need to parse a JSON file,
and i can't find a way to do it in processing), but i think that in the
future we will see more processing libraries like Ketai.
<h4>Oriented to Interaction</h4>
Processing was thought to "make things talk". Touch, move, shake, flip,
pinch, use it as natural as possible. The smartphone's surface could be a
superlative battlefield for
Processing, more than a computer screen. Since the beginning, you are dedicated
to the gestures, and not to technical aspects. That are still importants,
but that should not drive the application's development.
<h4>Low Barriers</h4>
Processing has catched the attention of a lot of designers and artists, because
it is easy to learn and to start using it. These 
people are an incredible resource to build better mobile applications. You 
don't need to be a programmer to start using this tool, you need ideas.

<h4>Some notes</h4>
What I'm saying, it's not that everyone can write android applications using
Processing. But everyone can start from it, because Processing it's a good starting point. If you
really want to write professional android applications, soon or later, you have
to know how the android APIs work. Take a look at the <a href
	="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">excellent android
	documentation</a>, know deeply, for example, what the activity lifecycle
is. This is stuff far
away from what artists and designers could be find interesting. But the glue
between some really technical documentation, and an approach oriented to the 
movement of your fingers on the smartphone's surface, could be Processing.
