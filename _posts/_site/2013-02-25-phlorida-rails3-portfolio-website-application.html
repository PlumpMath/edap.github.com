<h4>What</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/edap/phlorida">Phlorida</a> is a normal rails3 application that comes packaged with some gems that
may speed up your website development.
<h4>Why</h4>
Most of the time we (we intended as we, web developers) have to deal with the same
kind of web application: a website where the customer has an admin area behind a
secure authentication system, in which he can adds some pages, edit title and
content, or add some items (products, projects, fruits,
vegetables...whatever) in some categories. Maybe he wants to choose which page
should be the homepage, or which items should have a photogallery, and which
photos put in the photogallery. Well, Phlorida comes with a solution for this
kind of website.
<h4>How</h4>
I've started Phlorida because i wanted an admin namespace in this
<a href="https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan/"> web
	application
	</a>written by <a href="https://github.com/DanielKehoe">Daniel
	Kehoe</a>.Then I've added somes other features that i think i will reuse
in my future projects. Here a short overview:
<ul>
	<li>Authentication System through <a
		href="http://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a></li>	
	<li>Role Management with <a href =
		"https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a></li>	
	<li>Categories organized in a tree structure using <a
		href="https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry">Ancestry</a> as
	suggested in <a href
		="http://railscasts.com/episodes/262-trees-with-ancestry">Episode
		262</a> of Ryan Bates Railscasts</li>	
	<li>Twitter bootstrap with <a
		href="https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass">Bootstrap
	sass</a> gems</li>	
<li>Bootswatch themes with this <a
	href="https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails">gem</a></li>	
	<li>A Pages controller, with an homepage method, and the possibility to
	edit the page content with a <a href
		="https://github.com/Nerian/bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails">wysiwyg html5 editor</a></li>	
	<li>A galleryable polymorphic association, in order to simply upload
	photos in a photogallery with
	paperclip , and show this photogallery in the front-end
	using <a
		href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html">Twitter
	bootstrap Carousel</a></li>	
</ul>
<h4>Installation:</h4>
Clone the <a href="https://github.com/edap/phlorida">Phlorida</a> repo in a local folder. Move into it and create a .rvmrc file and a
gemset.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">rvm --rvmrc --create 1.9.3@yourapp
rvm gemset create yourapp
</code></pre></div>
Run "bundle install" and check that everithing goes ok. Now, Phlorida comes with
some data, like a user administrator and some pages, in order to run the
application as soon as possible. You can remove or edit this data later. Let's
create the database and add this data.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">db</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">schema</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">load</span>
<span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">db</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">seed</span>
</code></pre></div>
Run the server and open the browser.Done!
<h4>Customization</h4>
Phlorida is, after all, a rails app with some gems and 4 resources. These are
some small changements thought to run the app as soon as installed, that can
easily be removed or edited:
<ul>
	<li>I've mantained the registrable behaviour in Devise in order to allow the
	user to edit his profile but i've removed the possibility to sign up.
	I've adopted this <a
		href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6734323/how-do-i-remove-the-devise-route-to-sign-up">solution</a></li>
	<li>I've choosed the twitter bootswatch "Readable" theme. You can pick
	up another theme changing the word "readable" in the
	assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss file, with one of the availables
	themes</li>
	<li>I've put a "Login" link on the front end, but there is also a /login
	route available in case you would remove the link.</li>
	<li>In the application controller I've added a method to dynamically
	fetch the items needed for the menu. If you are not thinking to add
	pages or categories in the future, it's a good solution to write your
	pages and categories links statically in the _navigation partial, you
	will spare two queries.
	</li>
	<li>If you want to add some css classes, use the base.css file, that I
	leave empty.</li>
</ul>
