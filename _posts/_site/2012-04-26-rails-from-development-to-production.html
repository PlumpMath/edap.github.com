This article has no need to be read if you have seen <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/341-asset-pipeline-in-production?autoplay=true">this</a> excellent
Ryan Bates railscasts. After months, i've decided to subscribe his tutorials,
after all, they are a great way to learn rails, to be updated with all the new
stuff, and, last but not least,  they are really well
done.<br />Thanks Ryan!<br />
Moving an application to production can be a little tricky. With rails assets we
can avoid expensive http requests, all the css and the js files will be called
in only 2 files. That's great, but how it works?<br />
Let's start the apllication in production mode <br />
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">rails server -e production
</code></pre></div>
and we will probably catch this error
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">ActionView::Template::Error <span class="o">(</span>application.css isn<span class="err">&#39;</span>t precompiled<span class="o">)</span>:
</code></pre></div>
That's happen 'cause rails is looking for a compiled version of ours css files.
But we DONT have a precompiled version. To compile it, we have to be sure
that our Gemfile contain the required gems.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:assets</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sass-rails&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>   <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 3.2.4&#39;</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;coffee-rails&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 3.2.2&#39;</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;uglifier&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
Ok, now 
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">assets</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">precompile</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">trace</span>
</code></pre></div>
I've added the --trace flag 'cause more than one time this command has failed,
for differents reasons. The most common was the wrong css's files order with
twitter bootstrap and bootswatch. Now all our assets are under public/assets. We
can upload this folder on the remote server and tell rails to serve the static
files in this folder, add this line to your config/environments/production.rb
file.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serve_static_assets</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre></div>
Every time that for development purpose you will run your application in
development mode, rails will take the compiled files in public/assets. This may
be annoiyng when you are trying to improve your css or add new features in the
javascript files. I've searched for solution to avoid this beahviour, but I end
up that the best solution in to erase the folder public/assets, and then
recompile the files when you are ready to go to production.<br /><br />
