I've published two openFrameworks addons to generate L-System plants and fractals with openFrameworks. The First one is [ofxLSystemGrammar](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystemGrammar), an addon that generates sequences of string started from an axiom, the second one is called [ofxLSystem](https://github.com/edap/ofxLSystem) and it is a 3D turtle graphic interpretation of LSystem. Both addons come with examples included.
