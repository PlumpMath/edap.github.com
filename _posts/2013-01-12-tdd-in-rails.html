<h4>First: No code is safe.</h4>
Start asking your code: "Are you good enough to pass this test?". If he didn't
answer, write a test and fire the console.<br />Be active, don't wait until your
code start screaming. It's a common habit to think "i will write later my test
code". No, you will not, you will have other things to do, bug fixing, new
features, or take a walk outside, but no, abslolutely, no test code.<br /> To
avoid procrastination, testing has to be integrated in the development code
cycle, "you have to start thinking about testing before you write a line of
code"(tip 48, <a
	href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/codinghorror-20">The
	Pragmatic Programmer</a>). The most complete TDD definition that i've found on the net comes from <a href="http://www.agileskillsproject.org/agile-skills-inventory/technical-excellence/test-driven-design-tdd">agileskillsproject.org</a>:<br />
<i>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of driving the design of code by writing a test which expresses what you intend the code to do, making that test pass, and continuously refactoring to keep the design as simple as possible. TDD can apply at multiple levels, e.g., Customer Tests, Integration Tests, Unit Tests.<br />
Test-Driven Development/Design follows a rigorous cycle. Start by writing a failing test (Red.) Implement the simplest solution that will cause the test to pass (Green.) Search for duplication and remove it (Refactor.) "RED-GREEN-REFACTOR" has become almost a mantra for many TDD practitioners. Understanding and even internalizing this cycle is key to being able to use TDD to solve problems.</i><br>
Kent Beck rediscovered this technique in 2003, and from his book "Test-Driven Development by example" is taken this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle">part</a> on the wiki page about TDD.

<h4>Test Driven Development in Rails, common setup</h4>
How it work's on Ruby on Rails? First of all, you have to include some gems for
ours Integration tests. The most important is Rspec-rails for our integration
test (known as "request specs" in the context of RSpec), so edit your Gemfile,
add the following lines and run bundle install <br />
{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'rspec-rails', :group => [:development, :test]
gem 'factory_girl_rails', :group => [:development, :test]

group :test do
  gem 'database_cleaner'
  gem 'email_spec'
  gem 'launchy'
  gem 'capybara'
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
As you can see we have added also Capybara, FactoryGirls and DatabaseCleaner, during this post we will see how and when use them. Another step, is to tell rails that we wanto to replace fixtures with factories, and to suppress the creation of test files for views and helpers. Open your config/application.rb file and add the following lines:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Application &lt; Rails::Application
#...
config.generators do |g|    
  g.test_framework :rspec, :fixture => true
  g.fixture_replacement :factory_girl      
  g.view_specs false
  g.helper_specs false
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Now running "rails generate rspec:install" to preare your application for the testing you will have this files .rspec, the spec/spec_helper.rb, and the folder spec, that is used to store the test files. You can safely remove the folder "test", if you have created your app without the flag "-T".<br />
To write the rspec files from scratch, we will create a controller with some view.<br />
To do so, we will use the flag "--no-test-framework" to suppress the generation of the default Rspec tests.	
{% highlight ruby %}
rails generate controller Pages home help --no-test-framework
{% endhighlight ruby %}
After that, we'll generate the integration test file for the pages controller
{% highlight ruby %}
rails generate integration_test pages
{% endhighlight ruby %}
This will generate the file spec/requests/pages_spec.rb. Add this line at "require 'capybara/rspec'" in your spec_helper.rb file. Copy this file in another folder, called spec/features/pages_spec.rb.
Yeah, in spec/ we'll have 2 subfolders, one called requests and the other one called fetaures. In the folder spec/features we are going to store <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/2-12-2/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec">RSpec feature specs</a> (with capybara),  and in spec/requests/ all the <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/2-12-2/docs/request-specs/request-spec">RSpec request specs</a>. Request specs are intended to run Integratione test, feature specs are used to driving web application, cheking url and verify content.
Use the first one to test interactions with your application as a HTTP API. Use features specs (with capybara) to test your application like a user could do it. <br>
This is a necessary reading about <a href="http://alindeman.github.com/2012/11/11/rspec-rails-and-capybara-2.0-what-you-need-to-know.html">rspec-rails and capybara</a>.<br>
Now will write some test that HAS to fail.This is an important point, you are defining a new feature or starting from skratch, your code is not ready for your requirement. If the test does not fail, either your text was wrong, or your code was just ready to pass the test. Both, are wrong. You have to code untill your code pass the test. After that start to refactoring your code, write new test if necessary, and write the small amount of code necessary to pass the test. Now, back on the code.
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe "Home page" do
  it "should have the content 'this text is not here'" do
    visit '/pages/home'
    page.should have_content('this text is not here')
  end
end 
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Run this command and watch it fail. 
{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec rspec spec/features/pages_spec.rb
{% endhighlight ruby %}
It fails because in the page views/pages/home there is no text 'this text is not here'. Correct the view inserting this text and re-run the test. The same test for RSpec request specs (in spec/requests/), is slightly different.
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe "Home page" do
  it "should have the content 'also this text is not here'" do
    get '/pages/home'
    expect(response.body).to include("also this text is not here")
  end
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Note, i've write this example just to point out some differences between the two methods, but they should never be used for the same goal, each of them is more appropriated than the other in a specific context, it's up to you find the right one.
<h4>Use FactoryGirl</h4>
We are going to use factories to define Active Record objects and test them with insert/delete/edit methods. The most used gem for this scope is Facotry Girl. Like Rspec and Capybara, also FG has his own DSL.<br /> There are two ways to define factories:<b>1)</b> Using a single file, spec/factories.rb, or <b>2)</b> using multiple files, one file for each model. In his <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/158-factories-not-fixtures-revised">railcast</a>, Ryan Bates suggest to use one single file, but is up to you. Rails generator use by default the second method. Create a resource, a Post for example.
{% highlight ruby %}
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text
{% endhighlight ruby %}
And update the test db
{% highlight ruby %}
rake db:test:prepare 
{% endhighlight ruby %}
If the factory-girl-rails gem is correctly installed, this command has generated the file:  spec/factories/posts.rb. Open it
{% highlight ruby %}
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :post do
    title "MyString"
    body "MyText"
  end
end
{% endhighlight ruby %} 
This factory defines our ActiveRecord object for the model "Post", is the simplest set of attributes necessary to create an instance of this class. 
You have to edit your spec/spec_helper.rb, add "require 'factory_girl_rails'" after the other require declaration, and comment the line containing "config.fixture_path = "#{::Rails.root}/spec/fixtures", because we are going to use factories and not fixtures.<br>
We can use this class in our test. How? Let's start from the model, open /spec/models/post.rb and edit it like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Post do
  it "is valid with title and boby"
  it "is not valid with an empty title"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
If you run "bundle exec rspec spec/models/post_spec.rb" you will see a message like this:
{% highlight bash %}
**

Pending:
  Post is valid with title and boby
    # Not yet implemented
    # ./spec/models/post_spec.rb:4
  Post is not valid with an empty title
    # Not yet implemented
    # ./spec/models/post_spec.rb:5
{% endhighlight bash %}
That happens because we dont have defined the test. Open the file and add the following lines, note that we are using FactoryGirl to define the Post ActiveRecord object.
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Post do

  before(:each) do
    @post = FactoryGirl.build(:post)
  end

  it "is valid with title and boby" do
    @post.should be_valid
  end

  it "is not valid with an empty title" do
    @post.title = nil
    @post.should_not be_valid
  end

end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
We create a @post object at the beginning, some users prefere to specify the factory in every test, because you can just override attributes. Check this example
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Post do

  it "is valid with title and boby" do
    post = FactoryGirl.build(:post)
    post.should be_valid
  end

  it "is not valid with an empty title" do
    post = FactoryGirl.build(:post, title:nil)
    post.should_not be_valid
  end

end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
I prefer the second one, however, it's a matter of taste.
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Post do

  it "is valid with title and boby" do
    post = FactoryGirl.build(:post)
    post.should be_valid
  end

  it "is not valid with an empty title" do
    post = FactoryGirl.build(:post, title:nil)
    post.should_not be_valid
  end

end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
If repeating "FactoryGirl" is too verbose for you, we can can mix the syntax methods. Open you spec/spec_helper.rb and add this line 
{% highlight ruby %}
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryGirl::Syntax::Methods
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Now edit the spec/models/post.rb and remove the "FactoryGirl" word, because we don't need it anymore.
{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Post do

  it "is valid with title and boby" do
    post = build(:post)
    post.should be_valid
  end

  it "is not valid with an empty title" do
    post = build(:post, title:nil)
    post.should_not be_valid
  end

end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
If we run this test, we will see the second example failing. The post will be saved also with an empty title. That's Test Driven Development, we have define first what "should happen if", and then we write the code to adapt it to our test. Open the app/post/model.rb and write the following lines:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :body, :title
  validates_presence_of :title
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

<h4>Database cleaner</h4>
Database cleaner is a tool to clean the database before testing. Sometimes, for example in a user registration, some values has to be unique. For example, if we try to insert two times a user with the same email, we have this error
{% highlight bash %}
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Email has already been taken, Email has already been taken, Username has already been taken.
{% endhighlight bash %}
It's easy to setup, open your loved spec/spec_helper.rb file and add these lines
{% highlight ruby %}
RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.before(:suite) do
    #for sqlite use:
    # DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
    # instead the following 2 lines
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end

end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Nevertheless, FactoryGirl has a nice method to avoid duplication, the method 'sequence'
{% highlight ruby %}
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :user do
    sequence(:username) { |n| "foo#{n}" }
    password "foobar"
    email { "#{username}@example.com" }
{% endhighlight ruby %}

<h4>Watchr</h4>
It could be very annoying run a test each time we write something. There is a tool to automate this process, called <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">watchr</a>. Add it ro your Gemfile
{% highlight ruby %}
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'watchr'
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Next, add a file called .watchr in your app root folder, with the following content, that tell watchr to run a test each time a .rb file in your app is saved, and each time you save a changement in any file ending in _spec.rb under the spec/
{% highlight ruby %}
def run_spec(file)
  unless File.exist?(file)
    puts "#{file} does not exist"
    return
  end

  puts "Running #{file}"
  system "bundle exec rspec #{file}"
  puts
end

watch("spec/.*/*_spec.rb") do |match|
  run_spec match[0]
end

watch("app/(.*/.*).rb") do |match|
  run_spec %{spec/#{match[1]}_spec.rb}
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Open a new console window, and run "watchr .watchr". Nothing happen, true. But if you change a model, a controller or a file in spec/ your test will be running automatically. We can also create a rake task in lib/tasks/watchr.rake
{% highlight ruby %}
desc "Run watchr"
task :watchr do
  sh %{bundle exec watchr .watchr}
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}
and run watchr with "rake watchr". Credits to this solution go <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-and-rspec-2-4336.html">here</a>

<h4>Running your test</h4>
you can run the whole test with "rake spec", or simply "rake". You can run a single test with:
{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec rspec /spec/models/post_spec.rb
{% endhighlight ruby %}
and you can also run a test for a single line, giving the line number as parameter
{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec rspec /spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec.rb:10
{% endhighlight ruby %}
Why are we using 'bundle exec'? this is needed to load our exact gem environment specified in our Gemfile
