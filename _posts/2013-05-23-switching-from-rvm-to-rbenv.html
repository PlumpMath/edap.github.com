<h3>Why</h3>
Why should I switch from rvm to <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>? The last few years rvm helped me a lot
managing differents ruby versions and differents gemsets. Without this wonderful
tool probably rails development would have been much more complicated.<br />
So, why?<br>
The Unix way is pretty simple. One tool should make only one small and discrete
job, by this way of thought, rvm is too ambitious.Trying to manage ruby version AND
the ruby gems is too much work, especially when there is another tool to do one
of these works. Bundler. Bundler is absolutely the best tool ever to manage gems
(is there another one?), we need only one tool to deal with different ruby
version. And here we are, rbenv. A complete list of reasons is <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Why-rbenv%3F">here</a>
<h3>Exit rvm, enter rbenv</h3>
To install rbenv you have to disintstall rvm. Don't worry about your gemset, you
ain't gonna need it.
Disinstall rvm
{% highlight bash %}
rvm implode
{% endhighlight bash %}
I've to remove some folder manually due to some permission problems.
{% highlight bash %}
Now checkout rbenv in your home direcotry. Follow the instrucion reported here
<a href"https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#basic-github-checkout">https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#basic-github-checkout</a> to install rbenv in your home directory, configure your bash or zsh profile, and to install ruby-build, a plugin for rbenv needed to install the wished ruby version. After that, it will be very easy install new ruby version. Type 'rbenv install -l' to have a complete list of the availables rubies. Install version 2.0.0-rc2 with
{% highlight bash %}
rbenv install 2.0.0-rc2
{% endhighlight bash %}
It will start automatically to download the selected version.
{% endhighlight bash %}
Now, when you call for example'rake' rbenv pass the call to a directory in your environment PATH ~/.rbenv/shims. Shims are small executables that pass the call to the right command for that ruby version.
From the rbenv website:
<blockquote>Through a process called rehashing, rbenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Ruby command across every installed version of Rubyâ€”irb, gem, rake, rails, ruby, and so on.</blockquote>. After each installation we have to  
{% highlight bash %}
rbenv rehash
{% endhighlight bash %}

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight bash %}

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight bash %}

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight bash %}
