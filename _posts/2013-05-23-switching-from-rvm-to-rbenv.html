<h4>Why</h4>
Why should I switch from rvm to <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>? The last two years rvm helped me a lot
managing differents ruby versions and differents gemsets. Without this wonderful
tool probably rails development would have been much more complicated.<br />
So, why?<br>
The Unix way is pretty simple. One tool should make only one small and discrete
job, by this way of thought, rvm is too ambitious.Trying to manage ruby version AND
the ruby gems is too much work, especially when there is another tool to do one
of these works. Bundler. Bundler is absolutely the best tool ever to manage gems
(is there another one?), we need only one tool to deal with different ruby
version. And here we are, rbenv. If this is not enaough, you can read a complete list of reasons 
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Why-rbenv%3F">here</a>
<h4>Exit rvm, enter rbenv</h4>
To install rbenv you have to disintstall rvm. Don't worry about your gemset, you
ain't gonna need it.
Disinstall rvm
{% highlight bash %}
rvm implode
{% endhighlight bash %}
I've to remove some folder manually due to some permission problems.
Now checkout rbenv in your home direcotry. Follow the instrucion reported 
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#basic-github-checkout">here</a> to install rbenv in your home directory, configure your bash or zsh profile, and to install ruby-build, a plugin for rbenv needed to install the wished ruby version. After that, it will be very easy install new ruby version. Type 'rbenv install -l' to have a complete list of the availables rubies. Install version 2.0.0-rc2 with
{% highlight bash %}
rbenv install 2.0.0-rc2
{% endhighlight bash %}
It will start automatically to download the selected version.
Now, when you call for example'rake' rbenv pass the call to a directory in your environment PATH ~/.rbenv/shims. Shims are small executables that pass the call to the right command for that ruby version.
From the rbenv website:
<blockquote>Through a process called rehashing, rbenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Ruby command across every installed version of Rubyâ€”irb, gem, rake, rails, ruby, and so on.</blockquote>That's why after each installation we have to  
{% highlight bash %}
rbenv rehash
{% endhighlight bash %}
<h4>Defining the ruby version</h4>
rbenv look for the right ruby version to match in this order:
<ul>
<li>The RBEN_VERSION setted for your current session, you can define it with 'rbenv shell'</li>
<li>The ruby version defined in the current folder, in a file called '.ruby_version'. You can directly edit this file wiht 'ruby local'</li>
<li>The first .ruby_version file founded recursively back to the root of your file system</li>
<li>The global ~/.rbenv/version file. You can modify this file using the command 'rbenv global'</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where are my gemsets?</h4>
You don't need it. Bundler can manage all your gems for each ruby version. When you need to go online, simply put your gems in /vendor and you are ready to  go. Some more detailed explanations can be found <a href="http://rakeroutes.com/blog/how-to-use-bundler-instead-of-rvm-gemsets/">here</a>
