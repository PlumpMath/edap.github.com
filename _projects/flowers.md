This project consists of a small serie of 3D models of abstract flowers. The flowers are generated procedurally using the <a href='https://github.com/thi-ng/morphogen'>Morphogen Library</a>. The code used to generate the meshes below, and the instruction about how to export them, is available at this <a href='https://github.com/edap/flowers'>repository</a>
